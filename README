Hello everybody out there using linux -

I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and
professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing
since april, and is starting to get ready. I’d like any feedback on
things people like/dislike in linux, as my OS resembles it somewhat
(same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
among other things).

Likes:
  * GPL
  * POSIX compatible
  * mature (stable/robust)
  * large community
  * fast
  * multi platform

Dislikes:
  * UNIX style file permissions
  * drivers in the kernel tree
  * takes too long to compile
  * written in language that has no namespacing
  * written in language with a large vague and sometimes stupid specification
